#1st> To download image, build, re(creates), starts and ataches to containers for a service:
# and also if u delete the container, then again to build the container u have to run this single command.
docker-compose up


## For 2nd and 3rd step: Open the another command prompt 

#2nd> foloowing command dockers ps means “Process Status”, so docker ps basically shows all of the Docker processes actively running. docker ps lists all containers that are up and running:
docker ps

#3rd> Inspecting the particular container to get the IP address of that postgresql_db container:
docker inspect container_number
After this, copy the IP address of the postgresql_db continer and assign that ip address in pgdmin4 UI connection part, while adding the New Server.


Either follow the step 2 and 3 or skip 2 & 3 and directly go to docker-compose.yml file and view the postgresql_db container ipv4 address and paste it in while adding the new server.
